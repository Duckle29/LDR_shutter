# LDR shutter release

This is a simple PCB entirely inspired by the resinlapse cable.
This should simplify the process, by removing the need to solder the sensor to a cable.

# JLCPCB ordering
The "production" folder has files ready to let you order these assembled from JLCPCB. If people need help walking through that process, open an issue and I'll help :)
